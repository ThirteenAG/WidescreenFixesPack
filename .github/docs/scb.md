# Extraction Mode

Plugin adds an ability to modify the number of enemies for the Extraction game mode with `ExtractionWaveEnemyMultiplier` option.

New config for the Extraction game mode: Random, which randomizes the number and type of enemies in each wave using minimum and maximum values defined in the INI file.

To load custom configs for the Extraction game mode, create a folder inside `Splinter Cell Blacklist\src\SYSTEM\update\Data\ExtractionWaveConfigs\`, copy all XMLs into it, then set the name of the new folder in `ExtractionWaveConfigs` option in the INI file.

E.g.:

```
Splinter Cell Blacklist\src\SYSTEM\update\Data\ExtractionWaveConfigs\
NewConfig\
          DefaultWaveConfig.xml
          D_Amman.xml
          D_Bratislava.xml
          D_Kigali.xml
          D_Sanaa.xml
```

```
[EXTRACTION]
ExtractionWaveConfigs = NewConfig
```

> [!WARNING]
> Non-Windows users (Proton/Wine) need to perform a **DLL override**.
>
> <details>
> <summary>Click here for details</summary>

>
> You need to tell Wine explicitly to use the correct DLL overrides required for this plugin. There's more than one way to achieve it.
>
> ###
>
> **Method 1**: `WINEDLLOVERRIDES` variable lets you temporarily specify DLL overrides. It can be used from a command line as well as in the Steam launcher. In the case of the command line, simply prepend the usual start command with:
>    ```
>    WINEDLLOVERRIDES="version=n,b"
>    ```
> For Steam, head to the game's properties and set `LAUNCH OPTIONS` to `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="version=n,b" %command%`.
>
>  ![steam-wine-dll-override](https://silentsblog.com/assets/img/setup/steam-wine-dll-override.png)
>
> **Method 2**: Use `winecfg` tool to make a permanent override for a specific Wine prefix. In case of Proton, Steam creates the Wine prefix for Splinter Cell: Blacklist in `$HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/235600/pfx`. Then you need to run `winecfg` with that path:
> ```
> WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/235600/pfx" winecfg
> ```
> Select the `Libraries` tab and fill the combo box with the name of the library you wish to override and hit `Add`. You can verify that it's been added to the list below with `(native, builtin)` suffix. Then close the window with the `OK` button.
