> You need to tell Wine explicitly to use the correct DLL overrides required for this plugin. There's more than one way to achieve it.
>
> ###
>
> **Method 1**: `WINEDLLOVERRIDES` variable lets you temporarily specify DLL overrides. It can be used from a command line as well as in the Steam launcher. In the case of the command line, simply prepend the usual start command with:
>    ```
>    WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8,version,Xidi.32=n,b"
>    ```
> For Steam, head to the game's properties and set `LAUNCH OPTIONS` to `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8,version,Xidi.32=n,b" %command%`.

>
> **Method 2**: Use `winecfg` tool to make a permanent override for a specific Wine prefix. In case of Proton, Steam creates the Wine prefix for Splinter Cell: Conviction in `$HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/33220/pfx`. Then you need to run `winecfg` with that path:
> ```
> WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/33220/pfx" winecfg
> ```
> Select the `Libraries` tab and fill the combo box with the name of the library you wish to override and hit `Add`. You can verify that it's been added to the list below with `(native, builtin)` suffix. Then close the window with the `OK` button.
