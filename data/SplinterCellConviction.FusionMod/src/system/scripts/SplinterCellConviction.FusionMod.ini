// This is an experimental feature, it is not playable and intended for testing purposes only.
// Allows launching second instance of the game. Requires WindowedMode.
// Create a custom resolution to split the screen. E.g. 1920x1080 -> 1920x540.
// First instance will be positioned on top. Launch the second instance and connect via LAN.
// LAN matchmaking is not very stable, in case of an error try again, or restart both instances.
// Only first instance can host.
