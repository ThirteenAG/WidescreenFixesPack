;      DesktopResolution: Desktop (native) resolution can be forced for dgVoodoo's internal calculations.
;                         Useful for rare applications that pre-set the desktop to other than the native
;                         resolution before dgVoodoo gets in action. Only the compact format can be used here,
;                         and applies to all outputs of the desktop.
;        DesktopBitDepth: You can define what screen bit depth should be reported through dgVoodoo
;                         (8, 16, 32)
;           DeframerSize: When resolution is forced to other than the app default then
;                         a black frame is drawn around the output image coming from a wrapped API
;                         to remove scaling artifacts -
;                         frame thickness can be defined in pixels (max 16, 0 = disable)
;       ImageScaleFactor: Integer factor for scaling the output image coming from a wrapped API
;                         Always done by nearest point filtering, independent on scaling mode
;                         (0 = max available)
;                         Separate factors can be defined for horizontal and vertical scaling
;                         by subproperties, e.g.
;                         ImageScaleFactor = x:3, y:2
;      CursorScaleFactor: Integer factor for scaling the emulated hardware mouse (max 16)
;                         (0 = automatic, 1 = no scale, 2 = double scale, ...)
;             DisplayROI: Display region of interest
;                         If scaling is done by the dgVoodoo then you can define a subrect of the
;                         output image, coming from a wrapped API, to be displayed. The defined subrect
;                         is mapped to the display output according to the current scaling mode
;                         It can be useful for applications rendering a widescreen subimage into a 4:3
;                         resolution; in this case you can scale up that subimage to (nearly) fill the
;                         whole screen on a widescreen monitor.
;                         DisplayROI empty value means the whole image.
;                         DisplayROI value can be a proportion in form of %d_%d or a pixel size (%d|%d)
;                         Pos subproperty is not mandatory and can be 'centered' or a pixel position (%d|%d)
;                         Examples: DisplayROI = 16_9, pos:centered
;                                   DisplayROI = (320|200), pos:(10|10)
;             Resampling: When scaling is done by the dgVoodoo for the given scaling mode,
;                         you can choose which filter is to be used for resampling the output image
;                         Available filters are: "pointsampled", "bilinear", "bicubic", "lanczos-2", "lanczos-3"
;      PresentationModel: Low-level swapchain swap effect: if you know what you are doing then it can be
;                         overridden here. Flip models are better suited for modern OS features like auto HDR,
;                         while plain legacy models provide the best presentation performance under ideal conditions
;                         Not all model + output API + OS version combinations are supported.
;                         "auto", "discard", "seq", "flip_discard", "flip_seq"
;             ColorSpace: Color space of the swap chain:
;						  "appdriven"           - an application can choose argb2101010 through D3D9, but it means
;                                                 the legacy argb8888_srgb in any other case
;                         "argb8888_srgb"       - Legacy 32 bit output for SDR displays
;                         "argb2101010_sdr"     - 32 bit extended precision for SDR displays
;                         "argb2101010_sdr_wcg" - Wide Color Gamut format for SDR displays (available from Windows 11 22H2)
;                         "argb16161616_hdr"    - Float16 HDR output (available from Windows 10 1709)
;              FreeMouse: If true then physical mouse is free to move inside the game window
;                         when using emulated scaling and/or application and forced resolution
;                         differs; can be useful when a game relies on the physical window size
;     WindowedAttributes: You can define attributes for forced windowed appearance (separated by commas):
;                          "borderless"     - forces the app window not have any border
;                          "alwaysontop"    - forces the app window into the top-most band
;                          "fullscreensize" - forces the app window to be full screen size with image scaling inside
;   FullscreenAttributes: You can define attributes for fullscreen appearance (separated by commas):
;                          "fake"           - forces fake fullscreen mode with a screen-size window
;               FPSLimit: An integer or rational (fractional) value, 0 = unlimited
;            Environment: Software environment in which dgVoodoo is running: can be left unspecified (native)
;                         or can be set to 'DosBox' or 'QEmu'.
;        SystemHookFlags: You can define which part of the system should be hooked (x86-DX only):
;                          "gdi"            - for showing graphical contents rendered through GDI
;                                             (like movie playback through the ancient Windows Multimedia AVI player library)
;                          "cursor"         - for suppressing double-cursor symptoms when the cursor is emulated

;                                You can define what type of driver version and vendor id's the wrapper should report to
;                                the application; Some games rely on that information so it can be useful for them

;    ExtraEnumeratedResolutions: you can add extra resolutions (separated by commas, max 16) that will get

;                                can be useful if an app supports rendering at arbitrary resolutions

;                                or very special applications where you want to enable only individual displays on your monitor wall.

;              MSD3DDeviceNames: if true then original Microsoft D3D device names are exposed
;                                (some applications check for them and they fail)

;   RTTexturesForceScaleAndMSAA: if true then forced resolution scaling and MSAA is
;                                applied also to rendertarget textures
;                                Set it to false for games requiring pixel-precise rendering
;                                but be careful it can EASILY break certain things, not recommended

;         SmoothedDepthSampling: if true then extra smoothing is added to depth textures
;                                when they are sampled

;      DeferredScreenModeSwitch: If true the switching to full screen is deferred after the application initialized
;                                the DirectX device; can be useful for games that don't expect rendering window changes
;                                during initialization and crash

;   PrimarySurfaceBatchedUpdate: If true then direct changes of the primary surface are batched together for presenting them
;                                If false then each change is instantly presented (debug-like mode)

;          SuppressAMDBlacklist: Some AMD GPU models are blacklisted to workaround the solid-color-textures driver issue
;                                You can suppress it to check out if the problem is fixed in your current driver
