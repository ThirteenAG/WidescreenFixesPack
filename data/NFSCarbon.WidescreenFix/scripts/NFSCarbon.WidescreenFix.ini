CustomNOSTrailLength = 1.0               ; Adjusts the total distance of the NOS trail. You may need to adjust this if you're playing at very high FPS (240+). The higher the SimRate & FPS difference, the longer the trail.
FixNOSTrailPosition = 0                  ; Requires FixNOSTrailLength to be enabled. This will attempt to fix the trail from clipping the car by scaling its position away from the car.
